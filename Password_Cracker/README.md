# Password-Cracker  
This program is not the actual password decoder. It just shows the most basic way to crack passwords.

## Steps to run the program
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.
2. Dowload all the necessary packages by opening the terminal and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and hit enter.
3. Once its done run the script. A GUI window will pop up asking you to enter the password you want the program to guess.
4. On pressing enter you can see all the combinations the program is using to guess your password.
5. Once found it will display a message stating your password is: ur password.
6. And yea longer passwords equals more time to decode. So be ready to keep your system on for months for longer passwords with crazy combintions haha. To stop guessing come to the terminal and press CTRL+Z.
 
So all platforms suggest to keep long passwords with certain combinations so that it will take ages to decode if these type of programs are used.
