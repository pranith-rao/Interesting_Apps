# Password-Cracker  
This program is not the actual password decoder.  
It jut takes a password from the user and shows how decoding takes place and stops when password and password guessed by the system after trying a no.of commbinations are matched.   
And yea longer passwords equals more time to decode. So be ready to keep your system on for months for longer passwords with crazy combintions haha.  
If the length of password is known then it might take less time  
So all platforms suggest to keep long passwords with certain combinations so that it will take ages to decode if these type of programs are used.
