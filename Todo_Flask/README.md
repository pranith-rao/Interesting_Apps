# TODO Application
A todo application that I built while refering Code with Harry's Flask course. In the website you can save,update and delete your todo tasks.  
The website is built using HTML,CSS,Flask.

## Live Link
I have hosted the website using Heroku and the 'List of Commands' file in the repo contains the steps to be followed to host a website using heroku.  
~~Click on this url https://todo-pranith.herokuapp.com/ to view the website.~~  
Since heroku took down the free hosting service, the site is no longer hosted anywhere.

## Steps to run the application
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and type 'py app.py' and hit enter.
3. A link like http://127.0.0.1:5000/ will pop up in the terminal. Press Ctrl and click on the link to open it in the browser.
4. Boom! You are on the landing page of the application. Hope you complete your tasks on time!
