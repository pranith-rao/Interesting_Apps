# BMI Calculator
My first flask application. This app takes height and weight as input and calculates Body Mass Index(BMI) and presents the same as the output.

# Steps to run the application
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and type 'py app.py' and hit enter. 
3. A link like http://127.0.0.1:5000/ will pop up in the terminal. Press Ctrl and click on the link to open it in the browser.
4. Boom! You are on the landing page of the application. Happy Calculating!
