# Project 1
CS50 Project 1, also known as the Wiki project, is the first major programming assignment in the course. The project involves building a simple wiki web application using Python and the Flask web framework, which allows users to create, edit, and view wiki pages. The goal is to give students a practical understanding of how to build a basic web application and to introduce them to fundamental concepts such as HTTP, HTML, and SQL.  
Completed in June 2021.

## Steps to run the application
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open the Project_1 folder using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and run the command "py manage.py migrate".
3. Once the migrations are done, run the command "py manage.py runserver". 
4. A link like http://127.0.0.1:5000/ will pop up in the terminal. Press Ctrl and click on the link to open it in the browser. Boom! You are on the landing page of the application.
