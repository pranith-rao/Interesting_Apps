# Project 1
CS50 Project 1, also known as the Wiki project, is the first major programming assignment in the course. The project involves building a simple wiki web application using Python and the Flask web framework, which allows users to create, edit, and view wiki pages. The goal is to give students a practical understanding of how to build a basic web application and to introduce them to fundamental concepts such as HTTP, HTML, and SQL.  
Completed in June 2021.
