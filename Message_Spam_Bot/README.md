# Message-Spam-Bot
This script can be used to spam messages to your Ex :laughing: or to some youtube chat during giveaways.

## Steps to run the script
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.
2. Dowload all the necessary packages by opening the terminal and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and hit enter.
3. Once all packages are installed, save the message you want to spam in 'message.txt' file.
4. After that run the script. You got 5 seconds(can be increased or decreased) to place the cursor in the textbox where you want to spam.
5. Boom! After 5 secs message starts spamming. To stop the spam come to the terminal and press CTRL+Z.
6. I have included multiple scripts that can be used for different purposes. Comment and use it accordingly.
